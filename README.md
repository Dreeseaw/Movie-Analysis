Movie Dataset Analysis
William Dreese

Break open a movie dataset featuring over 43k movie entries of name, runtime, box office revenue, and movie summary. With some basic machine learning and data science tactics, I find the top 5 genres by projected box office revenue and the most chracteristic words of those genres.

Executing this project means having a few things installed, such as
-- Python>=3.6
-- Numpy>=1.14.3
-- Matplotlib>=2.0.2
-- Tensorflow>=1.8.0
-- Pandas>=0.23.4
-- Scikit-Learn>=0.19.1

By running "python main.py" with Python 3.6 (you might need to use python3.6 main.py), you'll be able to see a large chuck of my work in action, in real time.
